# Telegram_bot
Semi-automated Telegram BOT using NLTK 


Requires a corpus and images to send (stored in a local folder). It includes a function that returns an spectogram for every audio file received. Also sends a label corresponding the word it identifies (in english) using a CNN model trained on the well known Kaggle audio recognition challenge dataset.
